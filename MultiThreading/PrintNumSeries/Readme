Problem Statement

Suppose we are given a number n based on which a program creates the series 010203...0n.
There are three threads t1, t2 and t3 which print a specific type of number from the series.
t1 only prints zeros, t2 prints odd numbers and t3 prints even numbers from the series.
The code for the class is given as follows:

class PrintNumberSeries {

    public PrintNumberSeries(int n) {
        this.n = n;
    }

    public void PrintZero() {
    }
    public void PrintOdd() {
    }
    public void PrintEven() {
    }

}
You are required to write a program which takes a user input n and outputs the number series using three threads.
The three threads work together to print zero, even and odd numbers. The threads should be synchronized so that
the functions PrintZero(), PrintOdd() and PrintEven() are executed in an order.

Eg output :
0102030405
