Suppose we have a machine that creates molecules by combining atoms. We are creating water molecules by joining one
Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms. The atoms are represented by threads. The machine will wait for the required atoms
(threads), then group one Oxygen and two Hydrogen threads to simulate the creation of a molecule. The molecule then
exists the machine. You have to ensure that one molecule is completed before moving onto the next molecule.
If more than the required number of threads arrive, they will have to wait.

The threads can arrive in any order which means that HHO, OHH and HOH are all valid outputs.
