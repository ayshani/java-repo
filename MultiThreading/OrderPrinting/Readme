Problem Statement
-------------------

Suppose there are three threads t1, t2 and t3.
t1 prints First, t2 prints Second and t3 prints Third.
The code for the class is as follows:

public class OrderedPrinting {

    public void printFirst() {
       System.out.print("First");
    }

    public void printSecond() {
       System.out.print("Second");
    }

    public void printThird() {
       System.out.print("Third");
    }

}

Thread t1 calls printFirst(), thread t2 calls printSecond(), and thread t3 calls printThird().
The threads can run in any order. You have to synchronize the threads so that the
functions printFirst(), printSecond() and printThird() are executed in order.
