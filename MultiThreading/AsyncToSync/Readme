Problem Statement

Imagine we have an Executor class that performs some useful task asynchronously via the method asynchronousExecution().
In addition the method accepts a callback object which implements the Callback interface.
the objectâ€™s done() gets invoked when the asynchronous execution is done.

Your task is to make the execution synchronous without changing the original classes
(imagine, you are given the binaries and not the source code) so that main thread waits till asynchronous
execution is complete.

Output
------
I am done
Main Thread exiting!
