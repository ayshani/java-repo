Problem Statement
-------------------

https://www.educative.io/courses/java-multithreading-for-senior-engineering-interviews/Y5PWrR8DrN2

Suppose there are two threads t1 and t2. t1 prints Foo and t2 prints Bar.
You are required to write a program which takes a user input n.
Then the two threads print Foo and Bar alternately n number of times. The code for the class is as follows:

class PrintFooBar {

    public void PrintFoo() {
        for (int i = 1 i <= n;  i++){
        System.out.print("Foo");
        }
    }

    public void PrintBar() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        System.out.print("Bar");
        }
    }
}
The two threads will run sequentially. You have to synchronize the two threads so that the functions
PrintFoo() and PrintBar() are executed in an order.

O/P :
n = 3
FooBar
FooBar
FooBar
